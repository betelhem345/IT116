    <p>by Darryl Howard
        Ignorance is a notorious killer
        Always one step ahead of you
        You think you learned something new
        Only to find out that you are just scratching the surface...
        
        Ignorance is a notorious killer
        Sneaking in the back door of your home, unnoticed
        Stealing your goods, taking your children
        Silent and invisible, lethal and dangerous...
        
        Willful or neither;
        It's like the "song that never ends
        It goes on and on my friend
        People start to singing and not knowing what it was
        And they'll just keep singing it forever just because.."
    </p>
