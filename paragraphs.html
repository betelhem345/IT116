    <h1>Injera (sourdough flatbread)</h1>
      <p>“Injera is not a dish itself, but the vehicle for almost every <br>
          single meal in Ethiopia,” says Richman. Even a breakfast of <br> 
          stir-fried injera, known as fir-fir, is served with even more <br>
          injera on the side.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>


    <h2>Tibs (sautéed meat chunks)</h2>
      <p>The countrys “go-to meat dish,” as Curtis describes it, <br>
          is usually made from beef cut into small chunks and sautéed <br>
          in butter or oil with onions, garlic, hot pepper, and rosemary. <br> 
          You will find this on most general Ethiopian menus, served with <br>
          injera, naturally.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>


    <h3>Shiro be Kibbe (legume stew)</h3>
      <p>Says Richman, “This is Ethiopias peasant dish, although its <br>
        eaten by all classes and is the most popular dish in the <br>
        country.” The reddish, saucy dish is made by combining a <br>
        flour of ground split peas and chickpeas with kibbe, or <br>
        spiced clarified butter. Usually people eat shiro for fasting <br>
        season and it can be made either too spicy or with no spice at <br>
        all.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

    <h4>Kitfo (Ethiopian beef tartare)</h4>
      <p>Tartare fans, this might be your favorite new Ethiopian dish.<br> 
          Kitfo is ground raw beef thats been mixed with kibbe, the <br>
          spiced clarified butter. It can be accompanied by mitmita,<br>
          another popular Ethiopian spice blend. The result melts in <br>
          your mouth and tastes great with the typical accompaniments <br>
          of gomen (cooked greens) and a soft fresh cheese. A special <br>
          flatbread called kocho usually accompanies the dish, along <br>
          with injera. Says Curtis, “It is one of the dishes Ethiopians <br>
          are most proud of, and its always served at parties, holidays, <br>
          et cetera. We know of people who break the 55-day Easter fast <br>
          with kitfo.”</p>
